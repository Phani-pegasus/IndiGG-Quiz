A simple Quiz Application using HTML , CSS and JavaScript.

The logic used in every file is described as:

1. Quiz HTML Structure
The HTML structure defines the layout of the quiz page.It includes the quiz title, question display area, answer options, buttons for navigation and submission, and a timer display.
The page also contains a result section initially hidden from view.
2. Quiz JavaScript Logic
The JavaScript code dynamically generates quiz questions and answer options from a predefined array of questions.
It implements a timer for each question with a 15-second time limit. If the user does not select an answer in time, it marks the question as "Timed Out."
Users can navigate through the questions using the "Next" button and submit their answers using the "Submit" button.
The quiz score and correctness of each answer are displayed at the end, and a "Restart Quiz" button is provided.
3. Styling with CSS
The CSS file is responsible for styling the quiz page.
It sets background images, fonts, text alignment, and button styles to create an appealing user interface.
4. Restarting the Quiz
After completing the quiz, users can click the "Restart Quiz" button.
This button is styled with blue background and white text, with hover effects for interactivity.
When clicked, the page is reloaded, effectively restarting the quiz from the beginning.
